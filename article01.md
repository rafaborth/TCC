figure - field campaing and device installation
* quality analisys of raw signal and environmental interferences 
figure - lineplot concentrations, reference comparison, signal anomalies (limites, valores v√°lidos)
figure - errors timeseries and statistics
figure - correlation with environmental interferences 
* calibrating analisys
figure - timeseries raw data, reference and calibrated 
figure - scatterplots raw data, reference and calibrated detailing factor of two
table - statistics
